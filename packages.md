# Performance and Disk Efficiency
- NPM: when compared with yarn & PNPM. npm is bit slower

- Yarn uses the same flatten node_modules directory but is comparable to NPM in regards to speed and installs packages parallely.

- PNPM: PNPM is 3 times faster and more efficient than NPM.  With both cold and hot cache, PNPM is faster than Yarn.
